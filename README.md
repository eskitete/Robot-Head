# Robot-Head
Eyes and jaw cv control
This is my PBL project for HSA STEM SOS

I used py 3.7 to build this prograam since media pipe is best supported on it.

This connects to my inmoov robot head. using the seial import
The arduino code included (jaw.ino) reads the input from the python script to move the servos to wanted position.
